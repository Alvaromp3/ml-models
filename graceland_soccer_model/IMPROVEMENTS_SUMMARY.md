# ðŸš€ Advanced ML Improvements - Summary

## Implemented Features

### 1. âœ… Cross-Validation Metrics (K-Fold)

**What it does:**

- Implements 5-fold cross-validation to provide robust performance estimates
- Calculates mean, std, min, and max for each metric
- Shows performance ranges to assess model stability

**Where to use:**

- Automatically calculated after training regression or classification models
- Results displayed in the "Model Training" section

**Benefits:**

- More reliable performance estimates than single train/test split
- Helps identify overfitting across different data splits
- Professional-grade evaluation standard

**Implementation:**

```python
cv_metrics = compute_cross_validation_metrics(pipe, X, y, cv_folds=5, model_type='regression')
```

### 2. âœ… SHAP Values for Explainability

**What it does:**

- Explains individual predictions by showing feature contributions
- Visualizes feature importance with SHAP values
- Provides transparent, interpretable machine learning

**Where to use:**

- Available in "Model Training" section under "ðŸ”¬ SHAP Analysis"
- Expander section with summary plot

**Benefits:**

- Understand why a model makes specific predictions
- Identify which features drive player load or injury risk
- Build trust with coaches through transparency

**Implementation:**

```python
shap_values, X_transformed = generate_shap_analysis(pipeline, X_sample, features)
fig_shap = plot_shap_summary(shap_values, X_transformed, features)
```

### 3. âœ… MLflow Integration for Model Versioning

**What it does:**

- Automatically logs trained models to MLflow
- Tracks hyperparameters and metrics
- Enables model comparison and rollback

**Where to use:**

- Automatically executed after training any model
- Displays "âœ… Model logged to MLflow" message when successful

**Benefits:**

- Version control for ML models
- Track experiments and compare model performance
- Reproducible machine learning workflow
- Professional MLOps standard

**Implementation:**

```python
log_to_mlflow(pipeline, 'regression_model', metrics, params)
```

## Usage Guide

### For Your Project Presentation

1. **Cross-Validation**: Show robust performance with Â±std confidence intervals
2. **SHAP Values**: Demonstrate interpretability and transparency
3. **MLflow**: Highlight professional model management and versioning

### For Coaches

1. **Interpretability**: Use SHAP to explain why Player A is high-risk
2. **Confidence**: Cross-validation shows model reliability
3. **Tracking**: MLflow ensures model quality over time

### For Your Dataset

Since you'll use real Catapult data:

1. **Upload your CSV** in "Data Audit" section
2. **Train models** - all features will automatically use your data
3. **View cross-validation** to assess robustness on your dataset
4. **Check SHAP values** to understand what drives predictions with YOUR data
5. **Track in MLflow** - compare models trained on different dates

## Technical Details

### Files Added:

- `advanced_ml_extensions.py` - Contains all advanced ML functions
- Updated `app.py` - Integrated extensions into training workflow

### Dependencies Added:

```txt
shap>=0.42.0           # For explainability
mlflow>=2.8.0          # For model versioning
protobuf>=3.20,<5      # Compatibility constraint
```

### How It Works:

1. **During Training:**

   - Models are trained as before
   - Cross-validation runs automatically
   - Results logged to MLflow

2. **After Training:**

## Notes

- **Data Privacy**: Your real dataset stays local (not uploaded to GitHub)
- **Compatibility**: Advanced features gracefully degrade if dependencies unavailable
- **Performance**: CV and SHAP run automatically but may take 1-2 minutes on large datasets

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd graceland_soccer_model
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

**Method 1: Using the run script**

```bash
python3 run_app.py
```

**Method 2: Direct Streamlit command**

```bash
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

**Method 3: Alternative (if method 2 doesn't work)**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

> **Note**: On macOS, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`

### Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

**Option 1: Deploy via GitHub**

1. Go to [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New app"
4. Select repository: `Alvaromp3/ml-models`
5. Set Main file path: `graceland_soccer_model/app.py`
6. Click "Deploy!"
7. Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

**Option 2: Deploy from this directory**

```bash
# Install Streamlit CLI (if not already installed)
pip install streamlit

# Deploy using Streamlit Cloud CLI
streamlit deploy
```

### 🐳 Deploy with Docker

```bash
docker build -t graceland-soccer .
docker run -p 8501:8501 graceland-soccer
```

## Dataset Requirements

** IMPORTANT**: This application requires data exported from **Catapult Sports GPS tracking systems**. The CSV file must contain the following columns (or similar):

** Quick Start**: Use the included `sample_catapult_data.csv` to test the application without uploading your own data!

### Required Columns for Catapult Export:

- `Player Name`: Player identifier
- `Player Load`: Target variable for regression
- `Date`: Session date

### Recommended Performance Metrics (from Catapult):

The application works best with the following Catapult metrics included in your CSV export:

- `Work Ratio`
- `Energy (kcal)`
- `Distance (miles)`
- `Sprint Distance (yards)`
- `Top Speed (mph)`
- `Max Acceleration (yd/s/s)`
- `Max Deceleration (yd/s/s)`
- `Distance Per Min (yd/min)`
- `Hr Load`
- `Hr Max (bpm)`
- `Time In Red Zone (min)`
- `Impacts`
- `Impact Zones: > 20 G (Impacts)`

## Technical Details

### Models Used

#### Regression Model (Player Load)

- **Algorithm**: GradientBoostingRegressor
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler + Feature Selection + PCA
- **Expected Performance**: R² > 0.90

#### Classification Model (Injury Risk)

- **Algorithm**: LightGBM Classifier
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler + SMOTE + Feature Selection
- **Expected Performance**: Accuracy > 0.90

### Data Preprocessing

- **Outlier Handling**: Conservative cleaning
 - Removes only very extreme outliers (Z > 4.5 or beyond 4.5×IQR)
 - Drops rows only if flagged in multiple critical metrics
 - Also filters rows with many zeros across critical metrics (thresholded)
 - Safety guard prevents removal of >20% of data in one action
- **Missing Values**: Imputed using mode (categorical) and median (numeric)
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for normalization
- **Feature Selection**: SelectKBest / SelectFromModel

### Injury Risk Calculation

Risk categories are determined based on percentiles of Player Load distribution:

- **Low Risk**: Below 60th percentile
- **Medium Risk**: 60th to 95th percentile
- **High Risk**: Above 95th percentile (top 5% of load) OR high load combined with high energy expenditure and impacts

This balanced approach ensures approximately 40% Low, 35% Medium, and 5% High risk players in a typical squad.

## Performance Benchmarks

Elite Performance Targets:

- **Player Load**: 350-450 per session
- **Distance**: 4-7 miles per training
- **Sprint Work**: 200-400 yards high-speed
- **Energy**: 600-900 kcal per hour
- **High-intensity HR**: 15-25 minutes (85-100% max)

## Important Notes

- This system is designed to **support** coaching decisions, not replace professional judgment
- Always combine data insights with coaching experience and medical expertise
- Model predictions are based on training data and may require periodic retraining
- High injury risk alerts should trigger immediate medical assessment

## Support

For questions or issues, please refer to:

- The inline help tooltips ( **Coach Insight** boxes)
- Professional sports science resources
- Medical staff for injury-related concerns
